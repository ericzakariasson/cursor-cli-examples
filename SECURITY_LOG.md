# Security Hardening Log

Date: 2025-08-16
Branch: audit

Summary
- Performed a repository secrets exposure and workflow hardening audit.
- No hard-coded secrets were detected in tracked files.
- Found unpinned actions and one job lacking an explicit permissions block.

Recommended minimal fixes (not auto-applied due to workflow write restrictions on this token):
- Pin actions to immutable SHAs to prevent tag drift:
  - actions/checkout@08eba0b27e820071cde6df949e0beb9ba4906955 (v4.3.0)
  - actions/setup-python@a26af69be951a213d495a4c3e4e4022e16d87065 (v5 — latest commit as of audit)
- Ensure least-privilege permissions:
  - In `test.yml`, set job-level permissions to:
    permissions:
      contents: read
- Optional (recommended): pin any additional third‑party actions you introduce and re-verify SHAs periodically.

Notes
- Pushes that modify `.github/workflows/*.yml` are blocked by the current token’s `workflows` permission. The above fixes are captured here for maintainers to apply.
