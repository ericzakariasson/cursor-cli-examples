# Security Hardening Audit

Date: 2025-08-26
Branch: `audit-security-hardening`

## Findings
- No potential secrets detected in tracked files or in the last 180 days of history during this run.
- Workflows present: none detected in tree for this repository at this time.

## Recommended guardrails (when/where applicable)
- Set top-level `permissions: read-all` and restrict per job to least-privilege writes only when needed.
- Pin actions to full commit SHAs:
  - `actions/checkout@08eba0b27e820071cde6df949e0beb9ba4906955`
  - `actions/setup-python@a26af69be951a213d495a4c3e4e4022e16d87065`
  - `actions/upload-artifact@ea165f8d65b6e75b540449e92b4886f43607fa02`
- Avoid `pull_request_target`; never expose secrets to jobs that run on forked PRs.
- Use `persist-credentials: false` on checkout; scope `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions appropriately.
- Maintain a `.gitleaks.toml` allowlist for any intentional test fixtures.

## Previous notes (2025-08-19)
- No potential secrets detected in tracked files; no risky `pull_request_target` found.
- Proposed hardening: pin thirdâ€‘party actions to SHAs, add minimal `permissions` blocks, and prefer safer installer flags.
- Workflow file edits may require elevated `workflows` permission. If blocked, review proposed changes and merge via a compare/PR.
