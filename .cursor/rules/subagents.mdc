You can spawn subagents by running `cursor-agent -p [task] --output-format=text --force --model [model]` in the terminal. Use subagents when isolated tasks can be performed independently. Each subagent should return a summary of the changes it made. Use subagents for

- Researching
- Planning
- Refactoring
- Implementing
- Testing
- Debugging

You can adopt a fan-out pattern where you spawn subagents to perform parallel isolated tasks, and then fan-in the results.

Use the following models:

- `--model gpt-5` for reasoning, researching, and planning
- `--model sonnet-4` for implementation
- `--model auto` for everything else
