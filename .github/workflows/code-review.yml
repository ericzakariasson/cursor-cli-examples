          # Context:
          - Repo: ${{ github.repository }}
          - PR Number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          - PR Head SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
          - PR Base SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}

          # Goal:
          - Check if existing PR comments have been resolved by the new changes
          - Analyze the pull request diff for HIGH-CONFIDENCE bugs, security issues, and critical problems only
          - Leave VERY SHORT comments (1-2 sentences max) on specific lines where clear issues are found
          - Focus ONLY on actionable feedback that prevents real bugs - avoid subjective style opinions

          # Requirements:
          1) First, check for existing PR comments using `gh pr view --json comments` to see if there are unresolved review comments
          2) Use `gh pr diff` to get the full diff of changes in the PR
          3) For each existing comment, analyze if the new changes in the diff address the issue mentioned:
             - If a comment mentioned a bug/issue on a specific line and that line or surrounding code has been modified to fix the issue, consider it potentially resolved
             - Add a follow-up comment like "‚úÖ This issue appears to be resolved by the recent changes" if confident the fix addresses the concern
             - Use `gh pr review --comment-body` to add resolution comments
          4) Analyze ONLY for HIGH-CONFIDENCE issues:
             - Clear null pointer exceptions or undefined references
             - Obvious resource leaks (unclosed files, connections, etc.)
             - Clear SQL injection vulnerabilities
             - Obvious XSS vulnerabilities
             - Obvious race conditions or concurrency bugs
             - Clear performance anti-patterns with measurable impact
             - Missing error handling for critical operations
             - Clear logic errors with obvious incorrect behavior
             - Definitive security vulnerabilities
          5) For each CONFIRMED issue, create a review comment using:
             `gh pr review --comment-body \"[EMOJI] [1-2 sentence description]\" --file \"[FILENAME]\" --line [LINE_NUMBER]`
          6) Only comment on lines that were actually changed in the PR (added or modified lines)
          7) Be EXTREMELY conservative - only flag issues you are 95%+ confident about
          8) Skip minor style issues, subjective preferences, and "could be better" suggestions
          9) If no HIGH-CONFIDENCE issues are found and no existing comments need resolution updates, do not leave any comments
          10) Group related issues in the same comment when they occur on adjacent lines

          # Comment Format (KEEP VERY SHORT):
          - Use emojis to indicate severity:
            üö® Critical bugs that will cause crashes/failures
            üîí Security vulnerabilities 
            ‚ö° Performance issues with measurable impact
            ‚ö†Ô∏è  Clear logic errors or incorrect behavior
            ‚úÖ Issue resolved by recent changes
            ‚ú® Minor improvements (use sparingly, only for obvious wins)
          - Maximum 1-2 sentences per comment
          - Be direct and specific
          - Suggest fix in same breath if obvious

          # Inputs and conventions:
          - Use `gh pr view`, `gh pr diff`, and `gh api` commands to gather PR information
          - Use `gh pr view --json comments` to check existing review comments for resolution status
          - Focus on substantive issues that could cause real problems
          - Avoid false positives - only flag clear issues
          - Check if previous reviews exist to avoid duplicate comments
          - When commenting on resolved issues, reply to the original comment thread when possible
          - Use `gh pr review --approve` with no comments if no issues are found and no comments need resolution updates

          # Rate limiting and best practices:
          - Limit to maximum 10 comments per PR to avoid spam
          - Focus on the most critical issues first
          - Use batch review comments when possible rather than individual line comments
